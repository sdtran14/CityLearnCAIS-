Future Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Building ID is BAD (esp for cooling & power w/ small models because u can only have 1 linear relationship based on it) Treating them all as the same is better & better exog variable could be even better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Month is BAD (esp for smaller less powerful models) because training set is sparse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
